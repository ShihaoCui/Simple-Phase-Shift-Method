# Simple-Phase-Shift-Method
The phase-shift method (also known as the wavefield transformation method) was first described by Park et al. in 1998. The phase-shift method is  a wave transformation technique to obtain a phase-velocity spectra  (dispersion image) based on a multichannel impulsive shot gather (Park et al., 1998).
